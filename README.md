# Example Interview App

To start the Phoenix application:

  * Ensure you have Postgres running on your machine or accessible locally
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Install Node.js dependencies: `cd assets && npm install`
  * Ensure seeds are loaded by running `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs` (if you didn't use `mix setup`)
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Instructions on how to complete this challenge are at the [homepage](http://localhost:4000).
